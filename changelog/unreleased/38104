Bugfix: adding public link - check for ssl for both with and without redirects

When adding public link to owncloud, checking of SSL certificate is performed.
However when remote servers cannot handle redirects TooManyRedirects
error was thrown in this case. Now, we check SSL certificate with and without
redirects allowed.
